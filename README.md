# Social-App-Framework

* * *

Developed by Tim Santor, Social App Framework is a PHP framework with a very small footprint, built for PHP programmers who need a simple, straight-forward toolkit to create full-featured Facebook tabs and applications. Its goal is to enable you to get projects up and running much faster than you could if you were writing code to implement the Facebook PHP/JavaScript SDK's from scratch, by providing a set of libraries for commonly needed tasks.
