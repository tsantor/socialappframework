# Social-App-Framework

* * *

Developed by Tim Santor, Social App Framework is a PHP framework with a very small 
footprint, built for PHP programmers who need a simple, straight-forward toolkit 
to create full-featured Facebook tabs and applications. Its goal is to enable you 
to get projects up and running much faster than you could if you were writing code
 to implement the Facebook PHP/JavaScript SDK's from scratch, by providing a set 
 of libraries for commonly needed tasks.

###Background
Social App Framework was not something thrown together overnight. The framework
has evolved monthly, weekly, if not daily over the course of a year and a half.
The framework is very stable and has been "battle tested" over the course of that
time by powering around 20+ unique Facebook Tab, Canvas and Facebook Connect 
applications.
